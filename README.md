# tactcat.py
Small collection of crappy Transformice scripts
There's a thing to draw letters,
a thing to quickly check true-ratios from api.micetigri,
a thing to draw drawings (which is broken... I'm only mortal...),
a thing that READS OUT whispers to you (which is kind of broken too (no long whispers)),
and finally a thing to search youtube from chat (pulls first result (doesn't filter non-videos, though))
