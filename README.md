# tactcat.py

Small collection of crappy Transformice scripts  
There's a thing to draw letters,  
a thing to quickly check true-ratios from api.micetigri,  
a thing to draw drawings (which is broken... I'm only mortal...),  
a thing that READS OUT whispers to you (which is kind of broken too (no long whispers)),  
and finally a thing to search youtube from chat (pulls first result (doesn't filter non-videos, though))
