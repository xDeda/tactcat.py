#Drawing App

E - Draw line to point
Q - Split line
Z - Play back tracing under your cursor (but place up and left from where you want the drawing to be)

1. Hover your cursor over the canvas in the right side and press E to draw lines
2. Pressing Q somewhere breaks the line and your next E press will draw from Q to E
3. The transparency slider helps so you can trace an image beneath or determine size
4. Press the Update button before pressing Z to adjust your tracing properly
5. Z will play back your drawing relative to where you have your mouse cursor, so place it where you want your playback to be
6. Z will place your drawing to the right and down from your cursor, meaning the cursor indicates the top left corner of your drawing
