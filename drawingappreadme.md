Hover your cursor over the canvas in the right side and press E to draw lines  

Pressing Q somewhere breaks the line and your next E press will draw from Q to E  

The transparency slider helps so you can trace an image beneath or determine size  

Press the Update button before pressing Z to adjust your tracing properly  

Z will play back your drawing relative to where you have your mouse cursor, so place it where you want your playback to be  

Z will place your drawing to the right and down from your cursor, meaning the cursor indicates the top left corner of your drawing
